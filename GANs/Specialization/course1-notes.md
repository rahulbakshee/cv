## Discriminator:
The discriminator is a type of classifier that learns to model the probability of an example being real or fake given that set of input features, like RGB pixel values for images.The output probabilities from the discriminator are the ones that help the generator learn to produce better looking examples overtime.

The y(class) can be “real” or “fake” here. X is an image generated by Generator.


## Generators:
The generator produces fake data that tries to look real. It learns to mimic that distribution of features X from the class of your data. In order to produce different outputs each time it takes random features(noise) as input.

If we have only one class(y) , then the second term in the conditional probability will be ignored(coz it will be same always) and we will only have P(X). If we want to model the probabilities across all classes then we will have to put the second term.


The more common features(in the dataset) will be appearing more, and rare features will appear rare.

## Binary CrossEntropy(BCE):
The BCE cost function has two main terms that are relevant for each of the classes. Whether prediction and the label are similar, the BCE loss is close to 0. When they're very different, that BCE loss approaches infinity. The BCE loss is performed across a mini-batch of several examples, let say n examples, maybe five examples where n equals 5. It takes the average of all those five examples. Each of those examples can be different. One of them can be 1, the other four could be 0, for their different classes.


## training GANs : Discriminator
So to train a basic GAN, you alternate the training on the generator and the discriminator. So first of course you get some fake examples X hat produced by the generator from that input noise. And then those examples, the fake ones, X hat and real ones X are both passed into the discriminator without telling the discriminator just yet which ones are real and which ones are fake. And then the discriminator makes predictions Y hat of which ones are real and which ones are fake. Or more specifically a probability of score of how fake and how real each of these images are. After that, the predictions are compared using that BCE loss with the desired labels for fake and real. And that helps update its parameters or theta d, where d represents parameters for the discriminator. And so this only updates the parameters of the discriminator, only this one neural network, and not the generator.

## training GANs : Generator
so for the generator it first generates a few fake examples, again X hat, and this is from the input noise. And then these are again passed into the discriminator. But in this case the generator only sees its own fake examples. So it doesn't see the real examples at all. So it only knows that these are being passed to some discriminator. And then the discriminator makes predictions Y hat of how real or fake these are. And after that the predictions are compared using the BCE loss with all the labels equal to real. Because the generator is trying to get these fake images to be equal to real or label of 1 as closely as possible. And so this is where it's a little bit tricky and a little bit different between the generator and discriminator. Discriminator wants the fake examples to seem as fake as possible, but the generator wants fake examples to seem as real as possible. That is, it wants to fool the discriminator. And so, after computing the cost, the gradient is then propagated backwards and the parameters of the generator or theta sub g are updated.  it's only the generator, this one neural network that is getting updated in this process, not the discriminator.

So as you alternate their training, only one model is trained at a time, while the other one is held constant. So in training GANs in this alternating fashion, it's important to keep in mind that both models should improve together and should be kept at similar skill levels from the beginning of training. And so the reasoning behind this is if you had a discriminator that is superior than the generator, like super, super good, you'll get predictions from it telling you that all the fake examples are 100% fake. Well, that's not useful for the generator, the generator doesn't know how to improve. Everything just looks super fake, there isn't anything telling it to know which direction to go in. Maybe to add something a little bit more realistic and how to learn over time. Meanwhile, if you had a superior generator that completely outskills the discriminator, you'll get predictions telling you that all the generated images are 100% real. So when training GANs in this alternating fashion, it's important to keep in mind that both models should improve together. And should be kept at similar skill levels from the beginning of training. And the reasoning behind this is largely because of the discriminator. The discriminator has a much easier task, it's just trying to figure out which ones are real, which ones are fake, as opposed to model the entire space of what a class could look like. What all cats could look like. And so the discriminator's job is much easier than the generator's. One common issue is having a superior discriminator, having this discriminator learn too quickly. And when it learns too quickly and it suddenly looks at a fake image and says, this is 100% fake, I know this is fake. But this 100% is not useful for the generator at all because it doesn't know which way to grow and learn. And so having output from the discriminator be much more informative, like 0.87 fake or 0.2 fake as opposed to just 100% fake. One, probability one fake, is much more informative to the generator in terms of updating its weights and having it learn to generate realistic images over time.




## Transposed Convolutions and issues:
Transposed convolutions are used as an upsampling method and they have learnable parameters unlike, upsampling layers. A problem arising from the use of transposed convolutions, however, is that the output has a checkerboard problem.The output image has a pattern resembling a checkerboard and this arises because when you upsample with a filter, some pixels are influenced much more heavily while the ones around it are not. 

Using upsampling followed by convolution is becoming a more popular technique now to avoid this checkerboard problem.
