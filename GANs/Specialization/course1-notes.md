# Discriminator:
The discriminator is a type of classifier that learns to model the probability of an example being real or fake given that set of input features, like RGB pixel values for images.The output probabilities from the discriminator are the ones that help the generator learn to produce better looking examples overtime.

The y(class) can be “real” or “fake” here. X is an image generated by Generator.


# Generators:
The generator produces fake data that tries to look real. It learns to mimic that distribution of features X from the class of your data. In order to produce different outputs each time it takes random features as input.
