# Real-Time In-Store Sentiment Analysis [RISA]

In-Store analytics is very important when it comes to understanding 
- how customers feel when they are inside the store.
- how they feel when talking to a customer representative(rep).
- their overall shopping experience.
- efficiently managing the product placements.
- optimizing store operations.
- personalizing marketing content and recommending relevant producsts
- etc.

Companies/Retailers have been using image/video analysis of in-store customers' interactions to get insights for the above tasks. In this project we will build a Real-Time In-Store Sentiment Analysis system(RISA) to know more about customers's sentiments while they are inside the store.





Prototyped Facial Expression Recognition system for in-store customer analytics.

Achieved 89% accuracy using OpenCV for detecting facial bounding boxes and TensorFlow for multi-class classification of expressions trained on FER-2013 dataset.
